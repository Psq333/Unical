Perl Tutorial: A basic program</h1>
<hr>

<p>

Here is the basic perl program that we'll use to get started.
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# Program to do the obvious
#
print 'Hello world.';		# Print a message
</pre>

Each of the parts will be discussed in turn.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="firstline">The first line</a></h2>

Every perl program starts off with this as its very first line:
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
</pre>
although this may vary from system to system. This line tells the machine
what to do with the file when it is executed (ie it tells it to run
the file through Perl).

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="statements">Comments and statements</a></h2>

Comments can be inserted into a program with the <strong>#</strong> symbol,
and anything from the <strong>#</strong> to the end of the line is ignored
(with the exception of the first line).  The only way to stretch comments
over several lines is to use a <strong>#</strong> on each line.

<p>

Everything else is a Perl statement which must end with a semicolon, like
the last line above.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="printing">Simple printing</a></h2>

The <code>print</code> function outputs some information. In the above
case it prints out the the literal string <em>Hello world.</em>
and of course the statement ends with a semicolon.

<p>

You may find the above program produces an slightly unexpected result. So
the next thing to do is to run it.
