Substitution and translation</h1>
<hr>

<p>

As well as identifying regular expressions Perl can make
substitutions based on those matches. The way to do this is to
use the <strong>s</strong> function which is designed to mimic the
way substitution is done in the vi text editor. Once again the
match operator is used, and once again if it is omitted then the
substitution is assumed to take place with the <strong>$_</strong> variable.

To replace an occurrence of <em>london</em> by <em>London</em> in
the string $sentence we use the expression
<pre>
$sentence =~ s/london/London/
</pre>
and to do the same thing with the <strong>$_</strong> variable just
<pre>
s/london/London/
</pre>
Notice that the two regular expressions
(<em>london</em> and <em>London</em>)
are surrounded by a total of three slashes.
The result of this expression is the number of substitutions made, so
it is either 0 (false) or 1 (true) in this case.

<p>

<p>

<h2><a name="options"> Options</a></h2>

This example only replaces the first occurrence of the string, and it may
be that there will be more than one such string we want to replace.
To make a global substitution the last slash is followed by a
<strong>g</strong> as follows:
<pre>
s/london/London/g
</pre>
which of course works on the <strong>$_</strong> variable.
Again the expression returns
the number of substitutions made, which is 0 (false) or something greater
than 0 (true).

<p>

If we want to also replace
occurrences of <em>lOndon</em>, <em>lonDON</em>, <em>LoNDoN</em> and
so on then we could use
<pre>
s/[Ll][Oo][Nn][Dd][Oo][Nn]/London/g
</pre>
but an easier way is to use the <strong>i</strong> option
(for "ignore case"). The expression
<pre>
s/london/London/gi
</pre>
will make a global substitution ignoring case. The <strong>i</strong> option
is also used in the basic
<strong>/</strong>...<strong>/</strong>
regular expression match.

<h2><a name="remembering"> Remembering patterns</a></h2>

It's often useful to remember patterns that have been matched so that
they can be used again. It just so happens that anything matched in
parentheses gets remembered in the variables
<strong>$1</strong>,...,<strong>$9</strong>. These
strings can also be used in the same regular expression (or substitution)
by using the special RE codes
<strong>\1</strong>,...,<strong>\9</strong>. For example
<pre>
$_ = "Lord Whopper of Fibbing";
s/([A-Z])/:\1:/g;
print "$_\n";
</pre>
will replace each upper case letter by that letter surrounded by colons.
It will print <em>:L:ord :W:hopper of :F:ibbing</em>.
The variables
<strong>$1</strong>,...,<strong>$9</strong>
are read-only variables; you cannot alter them yourself.

<p>

As another example, the test
<pre>
if (/(\b.+\b) \1/)
{
	print "Found $1 repeated\n";
}
</pre>
will identify any words repeated. Each <strong>\b</strong>
represents a word boundary and
the <strong>.+</strong> matches any non-empty string, so
<strong>\b.+\b</strong> matches anything between two
word boundaries. This is then remembered by the parentheses and stored as
<strong>\1</strong> for regular expressions and as
<strong>$1</strong> for the rest of the program.

<p>

The following swaps the first and last characters of a line in the
<strong>$_</strong>
variable:
<pre>
s/^(.)(.*)(.)$/\3\2\1/
</pre>
The <strong>^</strong> and <strong>$</strong> match the beginning and
end of the line.
The <strong>\1</strong> code stores the first character;
the <strong>\2</strong> code stores everything
else up the last character which is stored in
the <strong>\3</strong> code.
Then that whole line is replaced with <strong>\1</strong>
and <strong>\3</strong> swapped round.

<p>

After a match, you can use the special read-only variables
<strong>$`</strong> and
<strong>$&amp;</strong> and
<strong>$'</strong> to
find what was matched before, during and after the seach. So after
<pre>
$_ = "Lord Whopper of Fibbing";
/pp/;
</pre>
all of the following are true.
(Remember that eq is the string-equality test.)
<pre>
$` eq "Lord Wo";
$&amp; eq "pp";
$' eq "er of Fibbing";
</pre>

<p>

Finally on the subject of remembering patterns it's worth knowing
that inside of the slashes of a match or a substitution variables
are interpolated. So
<pre>
$search = "the";
s/$search/xxx/g;
</pre>
will replace every occurrence of <em>the</em> with <em>xxx</em>. If you
want to replace every occurence of <em>there</em> then you cannot
do <strong>s/$searchre/xxx/</strong> because this will be interpolated
as the variable $searchre. Instead you should put the variable name
in curly braces so that the code becomes
<pre>
$search = "the";
s/${search}re/xxx/;
</pre>

<h2><a name="translation"> Translation</a></h2>

The <strong>tr</strong> function allows character-by-character translation.
The following expression
replaces each <em>a</em> with <em>e</em>, each <em>b</em> with <em>d</em>,
and each <em>c</em> with <em>f</em> in the variable $sentence.
The expression returns the number
of substitutions made.
<pre>
$sentence =~ tr/abc/edf/
</pre>

<p>

Most of the special RE codes do not apply in the tr function. For example,
the statement here
counts the number of asterisks in the $sentence variable and stores that
in the $count variable.
<pre>
$count = ($sentence =~ tr/*/*/);
</pre>
However, the dash is still used to mean
"between". This statement converts <strong>$_</strong> to upper case.
<pre>
tr/a-z/A-Z/;
</pre>

<h2><a name="exercise"> Exercise</a></h2>

Your current program should count lines of a file which contain a
certain string. Modify it so that it counts lines with double letters
(or any other double character).
Modify it again so that
these double letters appear also in parentheses. For example
your program would produce a line like this among others:
<pre>
023 Amp, James Wa(tt), Bob Transformer, etc. These pion(ee)rs conducted many
</pre>
Try to get it so that all pairs of letters are in
parentheses, not just the first pair on each line.

<p>

For a slightly more interesting program you might like to try the following.
Suppose your program is called countlines. Then you would call it with
<pre>
./countlines
</pre>
However, if you call it with several arguments, as in
<pre>
./countlines first second etc
</pre>
then those arguments are stored in the array
<strong>@ARGV</strong>. In the
above example we have <strong>$ARGV[0]</strong> is <em>first</em> and
<strong>$ARGV[1]</strong> is
<em>second</em> and
<strong>$ARGV[2]</strong> is <em>etc</em>. Modify your program
so that it accepts one argument and counts only those lines with
that string. It should also put occurrences of this string in paretheses.
So
<pre>
./countlines the
</pre>
will output something like this line among others:
<pre>
019 But (the) greatest Electrical Pioneer of (the)m all was Thomas Edison, who
