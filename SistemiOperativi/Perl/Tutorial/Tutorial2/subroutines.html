Subroutines</h1>
<hr>

<p>

Like any good programming langauge Perl allows the user to define
their own functions, called <em>subroutines</em>. They may be placed
anywhere in your program but it's probably best to put them
all at the beginning or all at the end. A subroutine
has the form
<pre>
sub mysubroutine
{
	print "Not a very interesting routine\n";
	print "This does the same thing every time\n";
}
</pre>
regardless of any parameters that we may want to pass to it.
All of the following will work to call this subroutine.
Notice that a subroutine is called with an <strong>&amp;</strong> character
in front of the name:
<pre>
&amp;mysubroutine;		# Call the subroutine
&amp;mysubroutine($_);	# Call it with a parameter
&amp;mysubroutine(1+2, $_);	# Call it with two parameters
</pre>


<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="parameters"> Parameters</a></h2>


In the above case the parameters are acceptable but ignored. When the
subroutine is called any parameters are passed as a list in the
special <strong>@_</strong> list
array variable. This variable has absolutely nothing
to do with the <strong>$_</strong> scalar variable. The following
subroutine merely prints out the list that it was called with.
It is followed by a couple of examples of its use.
<pre>
sub printargs
{
	print "@_\n";
}

&printargs("perly", "king");	# Example prints "perly king"
&printargs("frog", "and", "toad"); # Prints "frog and toad"
</pre>
Just like any other list array the individual elements of
<strong>@_</strong> can
be accessed with the square bracket notation:
<pre>
sub printfirsttwo
{
	print "Your first argument was $_[0]\n";
	print "and $_[1] was your second\n";
}
</pre>
Again it should be stressed that the indexed scalars
<strong>$_[0]</strong> and <strong>$_[1]</strong> and
so on have nothing to with the scalar <strong>$_</strong>
which can also be used without
fear of a clash.


<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="returning"> Returning values</a></h2>

Result of a subroutine is always the last thing evaluated. This
subroutine returns the maximum of two input parameters. An example of
its use follows.
<pre>
sub maximum
{
	if ($_[0] > $_[1])
	{
		$_[0];
	}
	else
	{
		$_[1];
	}
}

$biggest = &maximum(37, 24);	# Now $biggest is 37
</pre>
The &printfirsttwo subroutine above also returns a value, in this case
1. This is because the last thing that subroutine did was a
<strong>print</strong>
statement and the result of a successful <strong>print</strong> statement
is always 1.


<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="local"> Local variables</a></h2>

The <strong>@_</strong> variable is local to the current subroutine, and so
of course are <strong>$_[0]</strong>, <strong>$_[1]</strong>,
<strong>$_[2]</strong>, and so on. Other variables can be made local too,
and this is useful if we want to start altering the input parameters. The
following subroutine tests to see if one string is inside another, spaces
not withstanding. An example follows.

<pre>
sub inside
{
	local($a, $b);			# Make local variables
	($a, $b) = ($_[0], $_[1]);	# Assign values
	$a =~ s/ //g;			# Strip spaces from
	$b =~ s/ //g;			#   local variables
	($a =~ /$b/ || $b =~ /$a/);	# Is $b inside $a
					#   or $a inside $b?
}

&inside("lemon", "dole money");		# true
</pre>
In fact, it can even be tidied up by replacing the first two
lines with
<pre>
local($a, $b) = ($_[0], $_[1]);
</pre>
