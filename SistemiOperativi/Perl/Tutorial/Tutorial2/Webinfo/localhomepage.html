<h1> Creating a home page</h1>
<hr>

If you want to create your own home page in the School of Computer Studies
then there's no better place to start than the
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
Beginner's Guide to HTML</a>. You should find you can set up a home page
in a matter of minutes. Another excellent tip is that if you like
something on someone else's page, steal it. Use the View Source option
(under Mosaic's File menu and Netscape's View menu)
to see how other people wrote their pages.

<p>

Although undergraduates at Leeds don't generally have their home pages
on the Web this isn't really a problem. The most useful function
of a home page is to serve as your own
well-made hotlist to point to other
Web sites of interest. Write your home page as an HTML file called, say,
~/WWW/home.html. Make sure you set the permissions by using the
UNIX commands
<pre>
chmod a+x ~/
chmod a+x ~/WWW
chmod a+r ~/WWW/home.html
</pre>
Then if your username is sam, for example,
the local Web address of this file is
<pre>
file://localhost/home/csgi/sam/WWW/home.html
</pre>
(This is only for the SGIs. For the Suns replace the <code>csgi</code>
with <code>csun</code>.)
You can now open this file from Mosaic. Also, it's nice to
add the following line to the end of your ~/.cshrc file
<pre>
setenv WWW_HOME file://localhost/home/csgi/sam/WWW/home.html
</pre>
Now whenever you click on your browser's Home button it will take you to
your home page.

<p>

The only people who can access this page are you and anyone else with
an account on the same machine. This means you don't really have a
home page on the Web, just a home page for your own benefit. If you
aren't satisfied with this then before
lobbying your user rep you should consider
<a href="idealhomepage.html">
what you'd want to put on your Web page</a> that makes global
access so important. This isn't to say that it should always be forbidden,
only that it's not as important as some people think.
