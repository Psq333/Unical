<h1> You and your home page</h1>
<hr>

<p>

The World Wide Web is already a valuable resource to a whole lot of
people. But to make it really useful it needs your input. More
specifically, it needs information about you. This is because your presence
on the Web is crucial to its long term well-being, and it's vital that your
personal details are available globally, 24 hours a day, to
all the millions of people with Internet access.

<p>

For the benefit of humankind, then, here are some things that are essential
for your home page on the Web.

<h2> The fundamentals </h2>
</a>

<strong>An "Under Construction" banner.</strong>
Your page will need constant updating as you are inspired daily with new
thoughts and ideas. This banner will let people know that although they are
welcome to browse, nothing is yet finalised. It will also ensure that they
keep revisiting your page time and time again, eager to see your latest
additions.

<p>

<strong> Few pages, many headings.</strong>
Go for a few big pages rather than lots of smaller ones because it's very
helpful for your visitors to have all the information on hand at once.  Of
course with all this information
you'll need to use lots of different headings to signpost the reader. The
more headings you use the less text you'll need to put under them, and the
bigger the headings the easier it is to read. Ideally over half your text
will be very large headings.

<h2> Text</h2>
</a>

<strong> Your name lots of times.</strong>
The visitor to your page should be reminded of your name often for that
extra personal touch.  The average reader won't be able to read more than
two or three lines without a break, so the presence of your name will be a
welcome distraction. If you find it difficult to include your name so often
then a good tip is to write in the third person. So not "I like juggling
and watching TV and am a fan of Rush", rather "Brian likes juggling and
watching TV and is a fan of Rush". Even better would be "Brian likes
juggling and watching TV. Brian is also a fan of Rush". Use of the third
person also gives your page more authority; never mind that everyone knows
you wrote it yourself anyway.

<p>

<strong> Your favourite TV programmes.</strong>
The very fact that you've got one or more favourite TV programmes says a lot
about the kind of person you are. In particular if you're a fan of <em>The
X-Files</em> or <em>Twin Peaks</em> then you've obviously got something to
say about them and you should say it. Also, be aware that some people out
there are still arguing about which is better out of <em>Star Trek: The New
Generation</em> and <em>Babylon 5</em>. You know the answer to this. Tell
them. It's important.

<p>

<strong> Good use of emphasis.</strong>
Since there's a lot rubbish on the Net, and since whatever you say
is worth listening to more than anything else, you need to be heard
above the general rabble. An excellent way to do this is to use
emphased text such as bold and italics. In many places you'll see people
emphasise just the odd word or phrase, but this is a dead giveaway
that only those words and phrases are worth any attention. It's quite
obvious that if all your words are worth writing, as they surely are,
then all your words are important. This means that you should emphasise
not only complete sentences and paragraphs, but whole documents from
top to bottom. This will make it clearer to read and impress upon
the reader the seriousness and/or humour of your work. The more documents
you write the more you will be able to write with authority; eventually
you should be writing documents that are entirely in bold italics, and,
with the more advanced browsers, blinking on and off repeatedly.

<h2> Pictures</h2>
</a>

<strong> A picture of you.</strong>
To people in Tokyo, Seoul, the San Fransisco Bay Area and everywhere else
in the world you are very important.  They will want to see what you look
like because it really makes a difference to them. If you can, anchor your
picture so that they can click on it and get a bigger picture of you on an
external viewer. Then they can save this themselves; they might like to use
it as a background on their own computer.

<p>

<strong> Pictures of your pets.</strong>
Don't listen to those unfeeling individuals who say that all animals look
the same. Not only is this not true, be assured that your pets look cuter
and more heartwarming than any others in the world. If you have a cat, try
to get a picture of it peeking out from under a blanket or something. This
is always most amusing.  Even a goldfish has possibilities; try to include
several images of it from different angles so the reader can really get to
know it.

<p>

<strong> Pictures of your significant other.</strong>
It is of great interest to others as to who your amour is. Include lots of
pictures of them, and follow the same guidelines as for your own
picture. Of course if you're particularly important you won't have time for
an SO. In this case you'll probably be a fan of someone like Cindy Crawford
or Keanu Reeves, so you should include some pictures of them
instead. Since there aren't many pictures of these people already on the
Net you should make sure you have a good-sized collection. This will always
be interesting to others and can only improve your social standing.

<a name="sound">
<h2> Sound</h2>
</a>

<strong> A sound sample of you saying "Hi there".</strong>
Many newcomers will be a little apprehensive about reading a document about
such an important person. By including this sound sample you will put them
at their ease and reassure them that you're not the unapproachable
net.personality that they might mistake you for.

<p>

<strong> Samples of your favourite music.</strong>
Don't be put off by the fact that other music you've heard on the Net
either takes ages to download or is of terrible quality. You should include
samples that are both lengthy and of very high quality.  This is because
your excellent taste will become apparent as soon as the music is heard,
and your page's visitors will understand that the wait was well worth
it. However, since this isn't obvious before the information has been
downloaded don't let people know how big the files are, as this may deter
them unnecessarily.

<strong> A counter.</strong>
You should certainly include a counter on your home page to show how many
times it has been accessed; this will give you an accurate and useful
measure of how
popular you are. However it may be a high risk strategy if you're greatly
revered because you'll find many people are reluctant to bother such an
important person. In this case you can encourage them by posting articles
to a random selection of newsgroups and announcing that actually you
don't mind them browsing at all. You can always check the current total by
accessing your home page yourself. Although this does have the minor side
effect of bumping up the count a bit it's probably ignorable in the long
run.  Also, some people think the act of checking your current total is
similar to counting how many birthday cards you get each year, so it's best
not to tell anyone that you do it in case they get the wrong idea.

<p>

<strong> Message boxes.</strong>
Make sure you include a message box at the bottom of your home
page. Ostensibly this is so that people can send you comments, but really
it's just to broadcast the fact that you know how to do these things and
aren't you clever. In fact you'll probably find that you receive few if any
comments. The comments that you don't receive will be from people who are
so impressed they couldn't think of anything fitting for such a work of
art. On the other hand you'll probably find that the few comments you do
receive are from those people who mistook the box for a dictionary
search; do please remember that most people use dictionaries to look up
rude words and you shouldn't take these comments personally.

<a name="contact">
<h2> Contact</h2>
</a>

<strong> Your email address.</strong>
People will want know who is responsible for all this material, so your
email address should be displayed prominently in each of your
documents. When you have finally done this you can release your home page
onto the Web. Announce it in your favourite newsgroups and all the
Web-related groups. Then sit back and wait for the fan mail.
