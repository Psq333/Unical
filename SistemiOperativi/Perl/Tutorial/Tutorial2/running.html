Running the program</h1>
<hr>

<p>

Type in the example program using a text editor, and save it.
Emacs is a good editor to use for this because it has its own Perl
mode which formats lines nicely when you hit tab (use `M-x perl-mode').
But as ever, use whichever you're most comfortable with.

<p>

After you've entered and saved the program make sure
the file is executable by using the command
<pre>
chmod u+x <em>progname</em>
</pre>
at the UNIX prompt,
where <em>progname</em> is the filename of the program. Now to
run the program just type any of the following at the prompt.
<pre>
perl <em>progname</em>
./<em>progname</em>
<em>progname</em>
</pre>

<p>

If something goes wrong then you may get error messages, or you
may get nothing. You can always run the program with warnings using
the command
<pre>
perl -w <em>progname</em>
</pre>
at the prompt. This will display warnings and other (hopefully) helpful
messages before it tries to execute the program. To run the
program with a debugger use the command
<pre>
perl -d <em>progname</em>
</pre>

<p>

When the file is executed Perl first compiles it and then executes
that compiled version. So after a short pause for compilation the program
should run quite quickly. This also explains why you can get compilation
errors when you execute a Perl file which consists only of text.

<p>

Make sure your program works before proceeding. The program's output
may be slightly unexpected - at least it isn't very pretty. We'll
look next at variables and then tie this in with prettier printing.
