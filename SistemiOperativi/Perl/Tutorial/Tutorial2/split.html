A very useful function in Perl is
<strong>split</strong>, which splits up a string and
places it into an array. The function uses a regular expression and
as usual works on the <strong>$_</strong> variable unless otherwise specified.

<p>

The <strong>split</strong> function is used like this:
<pre>
$info = "Caine:Michael:Actor:14, Leafy Drive";
@personal = split(/:/, $info);
</pre>
which has the same overall effect as
<pre>
@personal = ("Caine", "Michael", "Actor", "14, Leafy Drive");
</pre>
If we have the information stored in the <strong>$_</strong>
variable then we can just
use this instead
<pre>
@personal = split(/:/);
</pre>

<p>

If the fields are divided by any number of colons then we can
use the RE codes to get round this. The code
<pre>
$_ = "Capes:Geoff::Shot putter:::Big Avenue";
@personal = split(/:+/);
</pre>
is the same as
<pre>
@personal = ("Capes", "Geoff",
             "Shot putter", "Big Avenue");
</pre>
But this:
<pre>
$_ = "Capes:Geoff::Shot putter:::Big Avenue";
@personal = split(/:/);
</pre>
would be like
<pre>
@personal = ("Capes", "Geoff", "",
             "Shot putter", "", "", "Big Avenue");
</pre>

<p>

A word can be split into characters, a sentence split into words and
a paragraph split into sentences:
<pre>
@chars = split(//, $word);
@words = split(/ /, $sentence);
@sentences = split(/\./, $paragraph);
</pre>
In the first case the null string is matched between each character, and
that is why the @chars array is an array of characters - ie an array
of strings of length 1.

A useful tool in natural language processing is concordance. This allows
a specific string to be displayed in its immediate context whereever
it appears in a text. For example, a concordance program identifying
the target string <em>the</em> might produce some of the following output.
Notice how the occurrences of the target string line up vertically.
<pre>

rrent developed and the frog's leg kicked,

ectrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edi

This exercise is to write such a program. Here are some tips:
<ul>
	<li> Read the entire file into array (this obviously
	     isn't useful in general because the file may be
	     extremely large, but we won't worry about that
	     here). Each item in the array will
	     be a line of the file.
	<li> When the chop function is used on an array it chops
	     off the last character of every item in the array.
	<li> Recall that you can join the whole array together with a
	     statement like <strong>$text = "@lines";</strong>
	<li> Use the target string as delimiter for splitting the
	     text. (Ie, use the target string in place of the colon
	     in our previous examples.) You should then have an
	     array of all the strings between the target strings.
	<li> For each array element in turn, print it out, print the
	     target string, and then print the next array element.
	<li> Recall that the last element of an array @food has index
	     $#food.
</ul>

As it stands this would be a pretty good program, but the target strings
won't line up vertically.
To tidy up the strings you'll need the <strong>substr</strong> function.
Here are three examples of its use.
<pre>
substr("Once upon a time", 3, 4);	# returns "e up"
substr("Once upon a time", 7);		# returns "on a time"
substr("Once upon a time", -6, 5);	# returns "a tim"
</pre>
The first
example returns a substring of length 4 starting at position 3. Remember that
the first character of a string has index 0.
The second example shows that missing out the
length gives the substring right to the end of the string
The third example shows that
you can also index from the end using a negative index. It
returns the substring that starts at the 6th character from the end
and has length 5.

<p>
If you use a negative index that extends beyond the beginning of the
string then Perl will return nothing or give a warning. To avoid this
happening you can
pad out the string by using the <strong>x</strong> operator
mentioned earlier. The expression (" "x30) produces
30 spaces, for example.
