Array variables</h1>
<hr>

<p>

A slightly more interesting kind of variable is the <em>array variable</em>
which is a list of scalars (ie numbers and strings).
Array variables have the same format as scalar variables except that they
are prefixed by an <code>@</code> symbol. The statement
<pre>
@food  = ("apples", "pears", "eels");
@music = ("whistle", "flute");
</pre>
assigns a three element list to the array variable @food and
a two element list to the array variable @music.

<p>

The array is accessed by using indices starting from 0,
and square brackets are used to specify the index. The expression
<pre>
$food[2]
</pre>
returns <em>eels</em>. Notice that the <strong>@</strong> has changed to
a <strong>$</strong> because <em>eels</em> is a scalar.


<p>

<h2><a name="assignments"> Array assignments</a></h2>

As in all of Perl, the same expression in a different context can produce
a different result. The first assignment below
explodes the @music variable so that it is equivalent to the second
assignment.
<pre>
@moremusic = ("organ", @music, "harp");
@moremusic = ("organ", "whistle", "flute", "harp");
</pre>
This should suggest a way of adding elements to an array. A neater way
of adding elements is to use the statement
<pre>
push(@food, "eggs");
</pre>
which pushes <em>eggs</em> onto the end of the array @food. To push two
or more items onto the array use one of the following forms:
<pre>
push(@food, "eggs", "lard");
push(@food, ("eggs", "lard"));
push(@food, @morefood);
</pre>
The <strong>push</strong> function returns the length of the new list.

<p>

To remove the last item from a list and return it use the
<strong>pop</strong> function.
From our original list the <strong>pop</strong> function returns
<em>eels</em> and @food now has two elements:

<pre>
$grub = pop(@food);	# Now $grub = "eels"
</pre>

<p>

It is also possible to assign an array to a scalar variable. As usual
context is important. The line
<pre>
$f = @food;
</pre>
assigns the length of @food, but
<pre>
$f = "@food";
</pre>
turns the list into a string with a space between each element. This
space can be replaced by any other string by changing the value
of the special <strong>$"</strong> variable. This variable is just one of
Perl's many special variables, most of which have odd names.

<p>

Arrays can also be used to make multiple assignments to scalar
variables:
<pre>
($a, $b) = ($c, $d);		# Same as $a=$c; $b=$d;
($a, $b) = @food;		# $a and $b are the first two
				# items of @food.
($a, @somefood) = @food;	# $a is the first item of @food
				# @somefood is a list of the
				# others.
(@somefood, $a) = @food;	# @somefood is @food and
				# $a is undefined.
</pre>
The last assignment occurs because arrays are greedy, and @somefood
will swallow up as much of @food as it can. Therefore that form
is best avoided.

<p>

Finally, you may want to find the index of the last element of a list.
To do this for the @food array use the expression
<pre>
$#food
</pre>

<h2><a name="displaying"> Displaying arrays</a></h2>

Since context is important, it shouldn't be too surprising that
the following all produce different results:
<pre>
print @food;	# By itself
print "@food";	# Embedded in double quotes
print @food."";	# In a scalar context
</pre>

Try out each of the above three print statements to see what they do.
