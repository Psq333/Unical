Scalar variables</h1>
<hr>

<p>

The most basic kind of variable in Perl is the <em> scalar variable</em>.
Scalar variables hold both strings and numbers, and are remarkable in
that strings and numbers are completely interchangable. For example,
the statement
<pre>
$priority = 9;
</pre>
sets the scalar variable $priority to 9, but you can also assign a string
to exactly the same variable:
<pre>
$priority = 'high';
</pre>
Perl also accepts numbers as strings, like this:
<pre>
$priority = '9';
$default = '0009';
</pre>
and can still cope with arithmetic and other operations quite happily.

<p>

In general variable names consists of numbers, letters and underscores, but
they should not start with a number and the variable <strong>$_</strong> is
special, as we'll see later. Also, Perl is case sensitive, so
$a and $A are different.

<h2><a name="operations"> Operations and Assignment</a></h2>

Perl uses all the usual C arithmetic operators:
<pre>
$a = 1 + 2;	# Add 1 and 2 and store in $a
$a = 3 - 4;	# Subtract 4 from 3 and store in $a
$a = 5 * 6;	# Multiply 5 and 6
$a = 7 / 8;	# Divide 7 by 8 to give 0.875
$a = 9 ** 10;	# Nine to the power of 10
$a = 5 % 2;	# Remainder of 5 divided by 2
++$a;		# Increment $a and then return it
$a++;		# Return $a and then increment it
--$a;		# Decrement $a and then return it
$a--;		# Return $a and then decrement it
</pre>
and for strings Perl has the following among others:
<pre>
$a = $b . $c;	# Concatenate $b and $c
$a = $b x $c;	# $b repeated $c times
</pre>
To assign values Perl includes
<pre>
$a = $b;	# Assign $b to $a
$a += $b;	# Add $b to $a
$a -= $b;	# Subtract $b from $a
$a .= $b;	# Append $b onto $a
</pre>
Note that when Perl assigns a value with <strong>$a = $b</strong> it makes
a copy of $b and then assigns that to $a. Therefore the next time you change
$b it will not alter $a.

Other operators can be found on the <strong>perlop</strong> manual page.
Type <strong>man perlop</strong> at the prompt.

<h2><a name="interpolation"> Interpolation</a></h2>

The following code prints <em>apples and pears</em> using concatenation:
<pre>
$a = 'apples';
$b = 'pears';
print $a.' and '.$b;
</pre>
It would be nicer to include only one string in the final print statement,
but the line
<pre>
print '$a and $b';
</pre>
prints literally <em>$a and $b</em> which isn't very helpful. Instead we
can use the double quotes in place of the single quotes:
<pre>
print "$a and $b";
</pre>
The double quotes force <em>interpolation</em> of any codes, including
interpreting variables. This is a much nicer than our original statement.
Other codes that are interpolated include special characters such as
newline and tab. The code <strong>\n</strong> is a newline and
<strong>\t</strong> is a tab.

<h2><a name="exercise"> Exercise</a></h2>

This exercise is to rewrite the Hello world program so that
(a) the string is assigned to a variable and (b) this variable is
then printed with a newline character. Use the double quotes and
don't use the concatenation operator. Make sure you can get
this to work before proceeding.
