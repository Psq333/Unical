What CGI scripts are</h1>
<hr>

<p>

Normally when a Web browser looks up a URL the following happens. First
your computer contacts the HTTP server with the URL. The HTTP server
looks at the filename requested by your computer and then sends that
file back. Your computer then displays the file in the appropriate
format.

<p>

However, it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever
a file in a certain directory is requested that file is not sent back;
instead it is executed as a program, and whatever that program
outputs is sent back for your computer to display. 
This function is called the <em>Common Gateway Interface</em> or
CGI. The programs are called <em>CGI scripts</em>. The directory
that the CGI scripts sit in cannot be specified by you alone - you
need the help of whoever runs your HTTP server.

<p>

In the School of Computer Studies here at Leeds it's
Support who run the HTTP server.
If you have an account here and you ask Support to give you a Web page 
and a CGI directory they tell the HTTP server where to look for your
Web files. For example, if your username is sam
then your Web pages can be put in directory /home/www/sam and your CGI
scripts in directory /home/www/cgi-bin/sam. When Support are told this
they make sure that when someone sends URL
<pre>
http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/sam/<em>filename</em>
</pre>
then the file /home/www/sam/<em>filename</em> is sent back. And
when they send the URL
<pre>
http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sam/<em>filename</em>
</pre>
then the file /home/www/cgi-bin/sam/<em>filename</em> is executed.
In all cases you have to set the permissions of the files and
directories so that everyone can read them. You also have to
set the permissions of all the directories and the CGI scripts so
that they are executable by everyone.

<p>

In summary
CGI scripts are programs which can generate and send back anything:
sound, pictures, HTML documents, and so on. In this tutorial we concentrate
on generating and sending back HTML documents.
